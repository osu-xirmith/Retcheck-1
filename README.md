# Retcheck Bypass by -Diesoin-#2024
  Code:
  ```cpp
 -void Retcheck(int Address, BYTE sBYTE) { //Shrapner-#2024 / -Diesoin-#2024 Retcheck
 -	DWORD nOldProtect;
 -	VirtualProtect((void*)Address, 5, PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE, &nOldProtect);
 -	*(BYTE*)Address = sBYTE;
 -	VirtualProtect((void*)Address, 5, nOldProtect, &nOldProtect);
 -}
 //Diesoin claims this is bait, apparently.  
  ```
   This is based on Variables Retcheck. His explanation of his Retcheck Bypass is here: https://v3rmillion.net/showthread.php?tid=148727 I recommend you to read this to find out more, it is a great thread to learn from.
 
   This would be a way would use this Retcheck Bypass. First you need to define the according to Variables thread, the 'offsetting bs'. This would be shown as:
   
  ```cpp
 #define getaddy(X) (X - 0x400000 + (int)GetModuleHandle(0))```
 
 Then after you had defined the getaddy, this would be lua_getfield (example, ):
 ```cpp
 void getfield(int L, int idx, const char *k) {
  Retcheck((int*)getaddy(GETFIELD_ADDRESS), 0xEB); // lol memes
  lua_getfield(L, idx, f);
  Retcheck((int*)getaddy(GETFIELD_ADDRESS), 0x72); 
 }
 ```
 
 
 
 -Remember that this is based on Variable's Amazing Retcheck.
